Description:
-A mythical animal from Johannas homeland
-It can't fly, the wings are for balance reasons (true for both the animal and for the construct)
-Instead of legs, it uses wheels to move forward. (compareable to wheel1.jpg, BUT the contruct itself is way bigger in comparison to the wheels).

-For attacking, it uses its horns (which are golden for the construct).
-It can also explode as it's filled with black powder.
