Name: Ice-Dragon
Power: 10/10

Description:
-It's filled with cogwheels and other stuff to look "very complex" (see Head.jpg).
-The body is made out of silver.
-Has wings made out of glass (like the Fire-Fly).
-If possible, add a small Watertank somewhere (around the chest area).
-It spits icecold (-20°C) water, which turns into ice nearly instantly (possible due to a special amaount of air pressure inside).

(Lore: It's designed to shoot Ice instead of Fire as the "Golem endboss" is immun to fire)

Size: 
The machine itself is 20 meters tall, able to mess with the roaming Golem (see Endboss.jpg).



Camera: Would be nice if the camera is positioned on the ground (as in Johannas view), gazing upwards to the Dragon.
